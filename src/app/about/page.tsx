        Hi there! The name is Lim Zi Heng, and you can just call me Ryan. Nice
        to meet you!

          I am a guy who have a lot of time but will make myself busy so that I
          don&apos;t have a lot of time. Maybe you might think that I like to be
          busy, but the truth is DEFINITELY NOT!

        <br />
        <p>And maybe this is the reason for a &quot;multitalented&quot; me.</p>

          So, to not waste time, here are some tags about the fields I am
          currently playing in, and I have been struggling and improving in some
          subfields of those specific field.
        </p>

          #naturalscience

        <br />
        <p>
          If you really want to know more about me (or you don&apos;t believe in
          any single one of the tags), feel free to check my social media
          accounts below.

        <p className="font-bold"> Have a nice day everyone!</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          P.S. Hopefully I can get this website out in a couple of days because
          there are a lot more ideas in my head and I really want to try them
          out after that!
