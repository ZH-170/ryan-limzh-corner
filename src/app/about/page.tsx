    <p>I am a guy who have a lot of time but will make myself busy so that I don't have a lot of time. Maybe you might think that I like to be busy, but the truth is DEFINITELY NOT!</p>
    <br />
    <p>And maybe this is the reason for a "multitalented" me.</p>
    <br />
    <p>So, to not waste time, here are some tags about the fields I am currently playing in, and I have been struggling and improving in some subfields of those specific field.</p>

    <p> If you really want to know more about me (or you don't believe in any single one of the tags), feel free to check my social media accounts below.</p>
    <br />
    <p className="font-bold"> Have a nice day everyone!</p>
