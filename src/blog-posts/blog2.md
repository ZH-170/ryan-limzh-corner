I am thinking of taking computer science course in my University, and now I am learning about some of those.
So, in my opinion, there are some fields in the world of computer science.

# Competitive Programming (CP)

This is the a field where you try to solve some problems using coding. Basically, you are given a problem about solving something, and what you need to submit is a code that shows the result that will take inputs and print expected outputs.

For example, there is a problem like this :

> Given two integers $a$, $b$ $(0 \leq a, b \leq 10^9)$, you need to print the sum of these two integers.

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| `1 2`        | `3`           |
| `10101 1010` | `11111`       |
| `1415 9265`  | `10680`       |

and here is a simple C++ code to solve this:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	int a, b;
	cin >> a >> b;
	cout << a+b << endl;
}
```

In the world of CP, we normally use C++ (including me myself) due to its low-level control and high-level features, and has one of the fastest execution times among other commonly used languages. Of course, there is also some of the competitive programmers uses other languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Pascal, ... and more!

To me, CP is not really a subfield focuses in programming. The main thing about CP is actually problem solving. You need to come out with a doable approach, and then only you code out your idea and submit it.

To be good at CP, joining contests is not enough, practice is really the point. By joining contests, you can know your strength and your weaknesses. And then, by practicing, you can `strength.push_back()` and `weaknesses.clear()`. This is how others master CP. There is a mostly used CP platform -- [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), and nearly every competitive programmer will use that to practice. So, if you are interested but have not started yet, what are you waiting for?

Although the result is not the best result, but the journey in the CP world really shows me the first face of the Computer Science world.

# Web development

This can be said to be another field in Computer Science. Personally speaking, it is about creating website and understand how the Internet works.

It started when I graduated, and I found out that I have a lot of stories to tell about my high school life. All those stories each represents a huge step in my self-improvements. I then realize I should use a tool to write down my stories so that it is more easily for me to show others what I've been through and what I've learnt (actually I just hope that I can use it to show my ability and get me in to a good university). Hence, I created my first portfolio website. By that time, I just try to rush it out and add the url into my university application form. But now only I found out that it is REALLY UGLY! So, I deleted that project, and start a new project, where I make another decent website, which is this https://ryan-limzh-corner.vercel.app/.

So, at the beginning, I didn't know that there are so much frameworks online, and what I first used is just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also think that learning while doing is a good way for me, so I rarely do any research before
There are a bunch of frameworks nowadays, and for now, one of the most used framework might be React. After researching about this, I then start to try it.

# Artificial Intelligence

There is a new annual Science Olympiad just held last year(2024), which is IOAI (International Olympiad of Artificial Intelligence). I then suddenly found out that this might be a good chance for me to learn about AI. Hence, I started learning the fundamentals of Machine Learning.

I follow a list of topics provided by the IOAI, and started to learn it through YouTube videos, GeeksForGeeks, and other online resources. And I think this time the way I learn really suites me. So, I would like to share the steps of learning ML that I used which is really effective.

First, I didn't spend too much time on the fundamentals, such as learn Python, Pytorch, and learn how to use some of its popular library: Matplotlib, Pandas, and others. I just simply have a look about how some examples and then skip this part.

Then, I started to learn about prediction and classification model. And things started to become complicated. You will then started to face a lot of new things you never heard before. I first try the way like "when I see a new phrase about ML, I just straightaway go understand what it is".

> For example, when I am searching for "Linear Regression", I found a thing call" Mean Square Error", and then after finish reading "Linear Regression", I then go find out what is "Mean Square Error", and I meet the phrase "Gradient Descent". Then when reading "Gradient Descent", I found "Lost Function". By this time, I know I heard of this phrase before (probably while reading the "Mean Square Error" part), but I can't immediately remember where I heard this, and what is the relationship between this and some topic I learned before.

This is very annoying, and as the number of reading becomes more and more, you will be confused by all of those topics. Hence, I used some time, separate the topics, and then classify them into larger topics with smaller topics in them, make sure all of it is clean and clear.

> Loss Function (Cost Function) : MSE, MAE, RMSE, R-square, Xentropy, ...
> Optimizer : SGD, Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad, ...
> Evaluation Metrics : Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ...
> Activation Function : ReLU, sigmoid, softplus, ...

So, by doing this, my learning process started to become easier and I can relate the new things that I learned with the old ones, resulting a deeper understanding about every little topics.

After finishing these basics, now you can start to have a try on creating a Jupyter Notebook and play around with the things you learnt. You can also try to follow the videos made by Andrej Karphaty on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy), "Neural Network: Zero to Hero" playlist. It is really recommended for beginners who are interested in LLMs.

# Other than programming...?

Besides these, I also found another field that might be interesting, and this field not only related to Computer Science, which is Game Development. I have already gathered some ideas from different noises of my brain.

I did some research and find out there are a lot of engines that I can use online, or you can WRITE YOUR OWN ENGINE with C. So, maybe I will really do something stupid like that in the future, or just get those game ideas done with an engine. Who knows?

So, by starting to learn all of these, maybe I can really chill in the introductory courses in university? Not really sure, but what I am sure here is that I have built a strong foundation in this subject, and I really find the way that is suitable for me to learn new stuffs which will definitely comes in handy in the future. As I believe in this saying:

The purpose of learning is not only to learn, but to learn how to learn.
